# WS-scale-hydropathy
A jupyter notebook file to calculate the hydropathy of signal peptides using Wertz-Scheraga scale.
Just enter the amino acid sequence of the signal peptide and desired window size.
Hydropathy score on the Wertz-Scheraga scale was found to be accurate to differentiate between Sec or SRP pathway as pathway a signal peptide opts for translocation of protein across the inner membrane of a bacterial cell (Huber _et al_, 2005).
However, the hydropathy score is only an indication and further proof may obviously be required to determine the pathway. It also does not hold true for Tat pathway signal peptides.
